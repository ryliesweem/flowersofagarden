        <p>Flowers of a Garden was created by <strong>Lily Farid</strong>, <strong>Rylie Sweem</strong>, and <strong>Natalie
          Musenga</strong>. This project was a culmination of our own personal reflections
          on culture and society. Each of us come from diverse backgrounds with
          diverse experiences and cultures. Together as a group we thought about
          how these differences in our cultures affected our roles in society.
          Did our differences make it harder to find a group of people or did they
          help us to build interesting relationships? Was culture even something
          that could be shared or does everyones unique experiences make the very
          idea of shared culture a mere illusion? And in our increasingly polarizing
          society, does culture band together or force us apart?</p>
          <p>Through these deliberations
          we decided to do some research. We consulted people both near and distant from
          us to gain their perceptions of culture and society, we looked at research in
          the field, we found quotes from influential people from all parts of the world
          and all kinds of cultures. <strong>We came to the conclusion that a diversity of
          culture is essential for the fabric of society.</strong> Differences should not be
          the reason for false dichotomies between groups of people but instead an
          opportunity for learning, understanding and growth. When we accept the
          diversity of humankind we are able to work together and make tremendous
          leaps in any field.</p>
        <p><strong>This projectÂ is meant to display the diversities of humanity and show
          the beauty of unity in diversity.</strong> We have collected responses from those around us
           on the meaning and effect of culture and placed them as flowers
          in the garden of humanity. We chose the format of origami because origami
          is a very cultural thing which the members of our group relate to. It also
          displays the humanity of our project and the imprints that each fold of
          life creates on our personal cultures. <strong>As an ever growing garden, we hope
          that this project can celebrate the differences that make us all members
          of one human family.</strong></p>
